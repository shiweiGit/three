This issue tracker is for reporting bugs or feature requests, not for asking questions. For usage questions, refer to the (documentation)[http://openlayers.org/en/latest/doc/].

- [ ] I have searched GitHub to see if a similar bug or feature request has already been reported.
- [ ] If reporting a bug, I have tried with the latest version of OpenLayers (see 'LATEST' on https://openlayers.org/)
- [ ] If reporting a bug, I have created a [CodePen](https://codepen.io) or prepared a stack trace (using the latest version and unminified code, so e.g. `ol-debug.js`, not `ol.js`) that shows the issue.
